# Introduction

A Vue native script todo app. Boilerplate for app creations.

## Set up

cd into the apps folder and run <code>npm install</code> and then <code>npm start</code> the emulator will not run unless you have downloaded and installed https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/.
Sign into your expo account via terminal.
Please install the expo app on your phones app store.
Then you can scan the QR code in terminal and emulate the app on your phone for development.
You can type <code>npm start</code> and then type <code>i</code> to emulate the app in an iOS device on my computer or use your phone for live reload, up to you!

## Training

I followed this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05LZ6-_FZj8&t=930s repo - https://github.com/TylerPottsDev/vue-native-todo-app

## Troubleshooting

Need node version 10 or above.

Need to have expo cli installed - https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/

Need vue native installed https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html <code>npm install --global vue-native-cli</code>

In order to start building an app inside the directory you need to run <code>vue-native init project_name</code>

Make sure you have xCode on your mac installed and updated to the latest version through the AppStore. You may also need to have a more recent OS in order to download xCode beta.
